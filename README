This is a Battlefield Bad Company 2 Stats program. 

It simply retrieves stats from BFBCS.com, and tells you what weapon stars you should be going for. It weighs medals by their point value, so that if you wish to rank up as quickly as possible, you will always know the best weapon to use. There's even user input, woo.
